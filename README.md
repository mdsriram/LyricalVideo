## LyricalVideo
LyricalVideo is a Python-based tool for creating lyrical videos by syncing lyrics with video content. This tool extracts lyrics, generates synchronized subtitle files in SRT format, and embeds these subtitles into a video using FFmpeg. It's designed to help users create engaging and interactive lyrical videos for music tracks.

## Features
- Lyrics Fetching: Retrieve lyrics for a given song using the Genius API.
- Subtitle Synchronization: Manually sync lyrics with timestamps and convert them into SRT format.
- Video Integration: Embed synchronized subtitles into video files using FFmpeg.

## Prerequisites
# Python
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Python is used to run the scripts and manage dependencies.

# LyricsGenius
This project uses the Genius API to fetch lyrics for songs. The Genius API provides access to a vast database of song lyrics and metadata. Below are the steps to set up and use the Genius API to retrieve lyrics.
1. Create a Genius Account
To use the Genius API, you first need a Genius account. If you don't already have one, sign up at Genius.
2. Obtain an API Access Token
- Create a Developer Account
   1. Visit the Genius API Developer page.
   2.  Log in with your Genius account credentials.
- Register Your Application
   1. Click on "Create an API Client" or "Register Your Application."
   2. Fill out the required details
      - Application Name: Enter a name for your application.
      - Application Website URL: Provide a URL for your application (a placeholder URL is acceptable if you donâ€™t have one).
      - OAuth Redirect URI: Use http://localhost:8000 if you don't have a specific URI.
    3. After registering, you will receive an Access Token.
3. Configure Your Environment
- Create a .env File
-- In the root directory of your project, create a file named .env and add your GENIUS_TOKEN
4. Install Required Python Packages
- Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
pip install lyricsgenius python-dotenv

## Usage
1. Prepare your lyrics and video
- Edit the main.py file to specify the song title, artist name, input video path, and output video path.
2. Run the script
  - Execute the following command in your terminal:

      ```bash
      python main.py

  - This will fetch lyrics, create a subtitle file, and generate a video with embedded lyrics.

## Files
- main.py: Main script for processing lyrics and video.
- fetch_lyrics.py: Module for fetching lyrics from the Genius API.
- lyrics_timestamps.py: Module for cleaning lyrics and converting them to SRT format.
- create_video.py: Module for integrating subtitles into the video using FFmpeg.
- .env: Environment file for storing API tokens and other configurations.
- requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.
- testcases.txt: List of testcases for the project functions.Each test case includes:
     - Function Name: The name of the function being tested.
     - Test Case Number: A unique identifier for the test case.
     - Input: The input values used for the test.
     - Expected Output: The expected result from the function.
## How to Run Testcases
- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
- Check the testcases.txt file for the specific test cases and expected results.
- Manually test each function according to the cases described.

For automated testing, consider implementing a test suite in a testing framework like unittest or pytest, which will read these test cases and validate the functionality.
